<h2 id="how-to-use">ü§î How To Use</h2>

#### üíª Installing & importing as a node.js/CommonJS module:

```sh
npm install node-haxball
```
```js
const { OperationType, VariableType, ConnectionState, AllowFlags, Direction, CollisionFlags, CameraFollow, BackgroundType, GamePlayState, BanEntryType, Callback, Utils, Room, Replay, Query, Library, RoomConfig, Plugin, Renderer, Errors, Language, EventFactory, Impl } = require("node-haxball")();
// Use example code here.
```

#### üíª Usage on Browser

  - NOTE: Usage on Browser currently relies on our <a href="https://node-haxball.glitch.me">proxy server</a>. (Will expire at the end of each month and not work for several days.)
  - If you do not wish to use proxy server (which has some limitations), you will need our browser extension to change headers. (look at our <a href="https://github.com/wxyz-abcd/node-haxball/tree/main/haxballOriginModifier">haxballOriginModifier project</a>.)
  - <a href="https://abc-haxball-proxy.infinityfreeapp.com/?no_proxy_server=true">Alternate URL</a> (No proxy server yet.)
  - Moreover; if you have a custom backend server for Haxball, you can use it with this API too.

#### üíª Example code using the library:

Joining a room:

```js

Utils.generateAuth().then(([authKey, authObj])=>{
  Room.join({
    id: "Olnit_iGRWs",
    authObj: authObj
  }, {
    storage: {
      player_name: "wxyz-abcd",
      avatar: "üëΩ"
    }, 
    onSuccess: (room)=>{
      room.sendChat("Hello " + room.name);
    }
  });
});
```

Creating a room:

```js

Room.create({
  name: "room123", 
  password: "password", 
  showInRoomList: true, 
  maxPlayerCount: 8,
  token: "thr1.AAAAAGNMOokNqt3forXs_Q.3qQMuLQOS9o"
}, {
  storage: {
    player_name: "wxyz-abcd",
    avatar: "üëΩ"
  }, 
  onSuccess: (room)=>{
    room.sendChat("Hello " + room.name);
    room.onAfterRoomLink = (roomLink)=>{
      console.log("room link:", roomLink);
    };
  }
});
```

<h2 id="docs">üì∞ Mini-Documentation</h2>

- `Library constructor(object, config)`: Initializes the library with given parameters.
  - `object`: These are objects/functions that directly affect the core functionalities. You should usually pass "window" here, because most of these objects reside there.
    - `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, (if you are on a custom environment such as NW.js or Electron, these functions should be binded to browser's window object before being passed on.)
    - `console`, `performance`, `crypto`, (browser's window object should have these objects as well.)
    - `RTCPeerConnection`, `RTCIceCandidate`, `RTCSessionDescription`, `WebSocket`, `XMLHttpRequest`, (these classes are used by Haxball for communication, browser's window object should have these classes as well.)
    - `JSON5`, `pako`. (These are two external libraries required by Haxball.)
  - `config`: Custom configuration for backend/proxy server as well as the library itself. Valid object keys are;
    - `backend`: Custom backend configuration. Valid object keys are:
      - `hostname`: backend's main domain url address. Defaults to: `www.haxball.com`.
      - `hostnameWs`: backend's url address for websocket connections. Defaults to: `p2p.haxball.com`.
      - `secure`: determines whether the url is using secure protocol(`true`) or not(`false`). Defaults to: `true`.
    - `proxy`: Proxy server configuration. Valid object keys are:
      - `WebSocketChangeOriginAllowed`: browsers' websocket libraries do not allow origin change for security reasons, so we need a proxy server to change the websocket request's origin for us. If `true`, we do not need a proxy server. (we can do that in NW.js, for example)
      - `WebSocketUrl`: proxy websocket url address to use when trying to create or join a room. should end with a `/`. Is appended `host` or `client` at the end while being used. Defaults to: `wss://p2p.haxball.com/` for host and `wss://p2p2.haxball.com/` for client.
      - `HttpUrl`: proxy http url address to use when trying to create or join a room. should end with a `/`. Is appended `host` or `client` at the end while being used. Defaults to: `https://www.haxball.com/rs/`.
    - `stunServer`: the url address of an external stun server that is required for the communication via WebRTC to work correctly. Defaults to: `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`.
    - `proxyAgent`: a global custom proxy agent for this api object. This method does not work in browsers. Defaults to `null`.
    - `fixNames`: fix some important variable names or not. Defaults to: `true`.
    - `version`: Haxball's expected version number. Defaults to: `9`.
    - `noVariableValueChangeEvent`: if `true`, disables the mechanism that enables variable value change event which in turn improves performance while reaching a variable's value that was defined by any `Addon.defineVariable` function. (Variable will have a directly accessable, actual value; instead of a property that points to the actual variable.) Defaults to: `false`.
    - `noWebRTC`: If `true`, skips the WebRTC initialization. Needed to be able to use the API functions that are not related to networking in environments without WebRTC support. Defaults to: `false`.
    - `identityToken`: A token that represents a user data in a database of a custom proxy/backend server. Defaults to `null`.

- `OperationType`: Different types of operations that are being used by Haxball. Should be used to understand what kind of message we are dealing with inside callback `onOperationReceived`.
- `VariableType`: Different types of variables that can be defined in a Plugin or a Renderer with its corresponding `defineVariable` function. Should be used in a GUI environment.
- `ConnectionState`: Different connection state values. Should be used to understand the state of connection while joining a room using `Room.join`.
- `AllowFlags`: These flags allow us to understand whether a plugin or a roomConfig is able to work correctly while joining or creating a room. Especially useful in a GUI environment.
- `Direction`: These values help understand the direction of a movement for an axis. Only designed for room.keyState function to combine seperate directions for x and y axis to generate the value of the key to press.
- `CollisionFlags`: These flags are used internally in Haxball's physics engine to decide whether collision check should happen or not. Useful while creating a map editor GUI.
- `CameraFollow`: These values help understand whether the camera will follow the player or not. This is only used as a variable in all stadiums.
- `BackgroundType`: This is the type of the variable in a stadium that defines its background texture type.
- `GamePlayState`: This type lets us understand the actual state of the game. This type only exists in a GameState object.
- `BanEntryType`: These values help understand the type of a ban entry instance inside a room's ban list.
- `PlayerPositionInGame`: These are the common player positions in most football manager games.

- `Language`: A class that defines a language. Any language should be based on this class.

  - `static properties`:
    - `current`: The global current Language instance. It is essential to assign a language object to this property to be able to see the error messages using a line such as `API.Language.current = new EnglishLanguage(API)`. Defaults to `null`.

  - `static functions`:
    - `resolveText(str, array)`: Converts a template string(`str`) to a normal string using the given parameters(`array`).

  - `constructor(abbr, metadata)`: creates a new `Language` instance. `abbr` should be a unique abbreviation string to identify the language. `metadata` is the information that you would want to show/update inside a GUI application.

  - `properties`:
    - `abbr`: the abbreviation of the language that is used while sending a LanguageChanged signal through the API.
    - `api`: The root data object that should have an `errors` key which has to contain string representations for each ErrorCode value.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `Language` object. These are defined in `Language.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `Language` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the languages in the examples folder uses the following `metadata` structure: `{name, version, author, description}`.

- `Errors`: Global error handling objects.
  - `ErrorCodes`: Name to integer mapping that shortly describes the error codes used in `HBError` class.
  - `HBError`: This is the class that is instantiated while any error is thrown from this API.
    - `properties`:
      - `code`: The error code that has been thrown. (`integer`)
      - `params`: Parameters for the error. (`array`)
    - `functions`:
      - `toString()`: Returns the full description of the current error object by executing `currentLanguage.errorsTextMap[this.code](...this.params)`.

- `Callback`: Global functions to add/remove callbacks.
  - `add(eventName, metadata)`: creates all callbacks about a new event called `eventName` which should start with a capital letter. `metadata` is not used, but this is the library's current metadata structure: `{ params: array of string }`. should be used (and maybe overridden for usage of `metadata`) in a gui application to define custom event callbacks related to gui events such as keyboard, mouse, touch, timer etc. the main event callback defined in this room object to trigger all callbacks is `"_on" + eventName`.
  - `remove(eventName)`: destroys the callbacks created by `Callback.add`.

- `Replay`: Functions/classes related to replays.

  - `read(uint8Array, callbacks, options)`: Creates and returns a non-blocking replay reader object. 

    - Parameters: 
      - `uint8Array`: Must be an Uint8Array containing the contents of a .hbr file. (Currently, only version 3 is supported.)
      - `callbacks`: An object that has the same callbacks as the renderer template. (except callbacks that are related to customEvents, roomConfigs, plugins, renderers, language; due to replay files not containing its corresponding event.) (Look at examples/api_structure/replayReader.js for all supported callbacks and example usage.)
      - `options`: An object that may contain the following keys:
        - `requestAnimationFrame`: Override function for `requestAnimationFrame`. (`null` = use library's default `requestAnimationFrame`.)
        - `cancelAnimationFrame`: Override function for `cancelAnimationFrame`. (`null` = use library's default `cancelAnimationFrame`.)
        - `fps_limit`: Any positive number that will be used as the fps limit. (`null` = no limit)

    - Returning replay reader object:
      - properties:
        - `state`: An object containing all information about the current room state.
        - `gameState`: room's game state information. returns null if game is not active. read-only.
        - `currentPlayerId`: Always returns -1. It is only added for compatibility with renderers. (And it is only used in the initialization code of renderers.)
      - functions:
        - `length()`: Returns the length of replay content in milliseconds.
        - `getTime()`: Returns the current time in milliseconds.
        - `getCurrentFrameNo()`: Returns the current frame number.
        - `setTime(destinationTime)`: Plays the replay until the `destinationTime`(in milliseconds) or end of replay is reached. Note that it may take some time to reach the destination time(especially if you are trying to rewind time), because the game state data is generated on the fly and not stored in memory. (It would probably use huge amounts of RAM.)
        - `setCurrentFrameNo(destinationFrameNo)`: Plays the replay until the `destinationFrameNo` or end of replay is reached. Note that it may take some time to reach the destination frame no(especially if you are trying to rewind time), because the game state data is generated on the fly and not stored in memory. (It would probably use huge amounts of RAM.)
        - `getSpeed()`: Returns the current speed of playing the replay.
        - `setSpeed(coefficient)`: Changes the speed of playing the replay. `coefficient` must be a real number >=0. 
          - `coefficient` = 0 : stop replay.
          - 0 < `coefficient` < 1 : slow-motion replay.
          - `coefficient` = 1 : normal speed replay.
          - `coefficient` > 1 : fast-motion replay.
        - `destroy()`: Releases the resources that are used by this object.
      - callbacks:
        - `onDestinationTimeReached()`: Destination time or frame number has been reached. Runs after a call to `setTime(destinationTime)` or `setCurrentFrameNo(destinationFrameNo)`.
        - `onEnd()`: The end of replay data has been reached.

  - `trim(replayData, { beginFrameNo, endFrameNo })`: Synchronously trims the given `ReplayData` between given frame numbers `beginFrameNo` and `endFrameNo`, both of which can be omitted and are inclusive. If omitted, `beginFrameNo` defaults to `0` and `endFrameNo` defaults to `replayData.totalFrames-1`.
  - `trimAsync(replayData, { beginFrameNo, endFrameNo })`: Asynchronously trims the given `ReplayData` between given frame numbers `beginFrameNo` and `endFrameNo`, both of which can be omitted and are inclusive.

- `Utils`: Some static utility functions.

  - `generateAuth()`: generates a new `player_auth_key` along with its companion auth object. you should store the key and use it later if you want to be recognized in Haxball rooms. the object is used in `Room.join`. returns `Promise([authKey, authObj])`.

  - `fake event triggers`: these functions are intended to be used in host mode to create/control in-memory bot players that will run much more efficiently than standard networking bot players. they also work for normal player objects, and can be used to create some events belonging to a player that did not originate from that player. most of these fake events also trigger an `onOperationReceived` call before being sent to clients.
    - `fakePlayerJoin(id, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth)`: triggers a fake join room event; which in turn creates a new in-memory player object. If there was a player before with this id, old resources are automatically reassigned to this new player object, and that player will wake up. 0 <= `id` <= 65535, all the other parameters must be a string. 
    - `fakePlayerLeave(id)`: triggers a fake leave room event. returns the player's properties so that you may pass them to `fakePlayerJoin` at a later time to wake that player. passing `id` = 0 causes desync on clients (because there's a special check for the case `id` = 0 in original clients). the player, although seemingly leaving the room, still watches the room, waiting for a fake player join event. all parameters except `id` may be different in the new `fakePlayerJoin` call, which allows player's `name`, `flag`, `avatar`, `conn` and `auth` to change without the player entirely leaving the room.

    - `fakeAutoTeams(byId)`: triggers a fake auto teams event that apparently came from `player(byId)`.
    - `fakeSetPlayerTeam(playerId, teamId, byId)`: triggers `player(playerId)`'s player team change fake event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. 0<=`teamId`<=2.
    - `fakeSetKickRateLimit(min, rate, burst, byId)`: triggers a fake kick rate limit change event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. `min`, `rate`, `burst`>=0.
    - `fakeSetTeamColors(teamId, angle, colors, byId)`: triggers `team(teamId)`'s colors change event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. 0<=`angle`<=180, `colors` must be an array of type (0 <= `integer` <= 16777215) that contains at most 4 integers.
    - `fakeKickPlayer(playerId, reason, ban, byId)`: triggers `player(playerId)`'s kick/ban fake event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. `reason` must be a string, `ban` must be `true` or `false`.

- `Library`: A class that defines a library. Any library should be based on this class.

  - `constructor(name, metadata)`: Creates a new Library instance with given `name`. `metadata` is the information that you would want to show/update/control inside a GUI application. `metadata` should be especially useful for version checks inside the `initialize` callback.

  - `properties`:
    - `name`: Name of the library. Must be unique. All `Library`s can be accessed with their names via `Room.librariesMap[name]`.
    - `room`: The room that this library is attached to.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `Library` object. These are defined in `Library.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `Library` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the libraries in the examples folder use the following metadata structure: `{version, author, description}`.
    - `defineVariable({name, value, type, range, description})`: Defines the variable with the given `name` and `value` inside this `Library` object. The rest of the properties are not used by default for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) This function should be used whenever a variable whose value is changeable from outside will be defined. Fires an `onVariableValueChange` event whenever this variable's value changes, if the global `config.noVariableValueChangeEvent` is not `true`.

  - `callbacks`:
    - `initialize()`: Only called once while creating or joining a room, or during a call to `Room.updateLibrary`.
    - `finalize()`: Only called once while leaving a room, or during a call to `Room.updateLibrary`.

- `RoomConfig`: A class that defines a room configuration object. Room configurations should be based on this class.

  - `constructor(metadata)`: creates a new `RoomConfig` instance. `metadata` is the information that you would want to show/update inside a GUI application.

  - `properties`:
    - `room`: The room that this roomConfig is attached to.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `RoomConfig` object. These are defined in `RoomConfig.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `RoomConfig` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the default roomConfig in the examples folder uses the following `metadata` structure: `{name, version, author, description, allowFlags}`.
    - `defineVariable({name, value, type, range, description})`: Defines the variable with the given `name` and `value` inside this `RoomConfig` object. The rest of the properties are not used by default for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) This function should be used whenever a variable whose value is changeable from outside will be defined. Fires an `onVariableValueChange` event whenever this variable's value changes, if the global `config.noVariableValueChangeEvent` is not `true`.
    - `setVariableGUIProps(varName, ...vals)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function might be used to modify some GUI properties regarding a specific variable called `varName`. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) `vals` should contain `{name: propName, value: propValue}` for each property named `name` that is required to set its new `value`. For example; in a GUI environment, `setVariableGUIProps("testVariable", {name: "visible", value: false})` could make the `testVariable` disappear from the GUI.

  - `modifier callbacks`:
    - `[dataArray, customData] = modifyPlayerDataBefore(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. dataArray format should be `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar]`. if `dataArray` is `null`, player is not allowed to join. also prepares a custom data object to send to all plugins. `customData=false` means "don't call callbacks". host-only.
    - `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar] = modifyPlayerData(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth, customData)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. `return null` -> player is not allowed to join. host-only.

    - `customData = onBeforeOperationReceived(type, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo)`: the host callback that is called only once for each message received from clients, and its return value is passed as customData to onOperationReceived callback. this callback is useful for parsing chat messages and other stuff that you would like to do only once, before the room callback or any plugin callbacks are called. The default callback value is a function that parses a chat message and returns `{ isCommand: boolean, data: string array }` where `isCommand = text.startsWith("!")` and `data = text.trimEnd().split(" ")`. 
    - `acceptEvent = onOperationReceived(type, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, customData)`: runs for each message received from clients. `type` is the type of the operation, `msg` is the original message, `customData` is the return value of callback `onBeforeOperationReceived(type, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo)`. `onOperationReceived` is called only once for each message, before all `onOperationReceived` callbacks of all plugins are called for the same message. you may modify msg's contents here as you wish. `return true` -> accept event, `return false` -> block message from being processed, `throw exception` -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.
    - `acceptEvent = onAfterOperationReceived(type, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, customData)`: runs for each message received from clients. `type` is the type of the operation, `msg` is the original message, `customData` is the return value of callback `onOperationReceived(type, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, msg)`. `onAfterOperationReceived` is called only once for each message, after all `onOperationReceived` callbacks of all plugins are called for the same message. you may modify msg's contents here as you wish. `return true` -> accept event, `return false` -> block message from being processed, `throw exception` -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.

- `Plugin`: A class that defines a plugin. Any plugin should be based on this class.

  - `constructor(name, active, metadata)`: creates a new Plugin instance. A plugin is automatically activated just after initialization, while a Room object is being created, if active is true. Metadata is the information that you would want to show/update inside a GUI application.

  - `properties`:
    - `name`: name of the plugin. Must be unique, and is used internally in `Room.setPluginActive`. All Plugins can be accessed with their names via `Room.pluginsMap[name]`.
    - `active`: activation status of the plugin. You should use `Room.setPluginActive(name, active)` if you want to modify this value manually.
    - `room`: The room that this plugin is attached to.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `Plugin` object. These are defined in `Plugin.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `Plugin` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the plugins in the examples folder use the following metadata structure: `{version, author, description, allowFlags}`.
    - `defineVariable({name, value, type, range, description})`: Defines the variable with the given `name` and `value` inside this `Plugin` object. The rest of the properties are not used by default for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) This function should be used whenever a variable whose value is changeable from outside will be defined. Fires an `onVariableValueChange` event whenever this variable's value changes, if the global `config.noVariableValueChangeEvent` is not `true`.

  - `modifier callbacks`:
    - `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar] = modifyPlayerData(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth, customData)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. `return null` -> player is not allowed to join. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyPlayerDataBefore`. host-only.

    - `newPing = modifyClientPing(ping, customData)`: set current player's `ping`. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyClientPingBefore`. client-only.
    - `newFrameNo = modifyFrameNo(frameNo, customData)`: set current player's `frameNo`. causes your player to look laggy to your opponents, especially on extrapolated clients. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyFrameNoBefore`. client-only.
    - `acceptEvent = onOperationReceived(type, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, customData)`:  runs for each message received from clients. `type` is the type of the operation, `msg` is the original message. you may modify `msg`'s contents here as you wish. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.onBeforeOperationReceived`. `return true` -> accept event, `return false` -> block message from being processed, `throw exception` -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.

  - `callbacks`:
    - `initialize()`: only called once while creating or joining a room, or during a call to `Room.updatePlugin`.
    - `finalize()`: only called once while leaving a room, or during a call to `Room.updatePlugin`.
    - `onXXXXXXX(..., customData)`: (where `XXXXXXX` is the name of the event) called after `room.onBeforeXXXXXXX(...)` and before `room.onAfterXXXXXXX(..., customData)`. `customData` is the object that might be returned from `room.onBeforeXXXXXXX(...)`.
      - `onRoomLink(link, customData)`: room link was received. host-only.

- `Renderer`: A class that defines a renderer. Any renderer should be based on this class.

  - `constructor(metadata)`: creates a new `Renderer` instance. `metadata` is the information that you would want to show/update inside a GUI application.

  - `properties`:
    - `room`: The room that this renderer is attached to.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `Renderer` object. These are defined in `Renderer.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `Renderer` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the default renderer in the examples folder uses the following `metadata` structure: `{name, version, author, description}`.
    - `defineVariable({name, value, type, range, description})`: Defines the variable with the given `name` and `value` inside this `Renderer` object. The rest of the properties are not used by default for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) This function should be used whenever a variable whose value is changeable from outside will be defined. Fires an `onVariableValueChange` event whenever this variable's value changes, if the global `config.noVariableValueChangeEvent` is not `true`.

  - `callbacks`:
    - `initialize()`: only called once while creating or joining a room, or during a call to `Room.setRenderer`.
    - `finalize()`: only called once while leaving a room, or during a call to `Room.setRenderer`.
    - `render(extrapolatedRoomState)`: called inside `requestAnimationFrame` callback. rendering logic should be here. 
    - `onXXXXXXX(..., customData)`: (where `XXXXXXX` is the name of the event) called after the respective plugin callbacks `plugin.onXXXXXXX(...)` and `room.onXXXXXXX(..., customData)`. `customData` is the object that might be returned from the last call of `plugin.onXXXXXXX(...)` or `room.onXXXXXXX(...)`.
